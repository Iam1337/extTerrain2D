## Introduction
extTerrain2D is a tool dedicated to create 2D terrains by beizer curve. It generates a mesh with two materials (two submesh) and colliders. Just look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7iCimyGXHo).

## Installation:

**Old school**

Just copy the [Assets/extTerrain2D](Assets/extTerrain2D) folder into your Assets directory within your Unity project, or [download latest extTerrain2D.unitypackage](https://github.com/iam1337/extTerrain2D/releases).

**OpenUPM**

Via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli):<br>
```
openupm add com.iam1337.extterrain2d
```

Or if you don't have it, add the scoped registry to manifest.json with the desired dependency semantic version:

```
"scopedRegistries": [
	{
		"name": "package.openupm.com",
		"url": "https://package.openupm.com",
		"scopes": [
			"com.iam1337.extterrain2d",
		]
	}
],
"dependencies": {
	"com.iam1337.extosc.extterrain2d": "1.0.0",
}
```

**Package Manager**

Project supports Unity Package Manager. To install the project as a Git package do the following:

1. In Unity, open **Window > Package Manager**.
2. Press the **+** button, choose **"Add package from git URL..."**
3. Enter "https://github.com/iam1337/extTerrain2D.git#upm" and press Add.
